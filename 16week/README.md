### Step 5: Zenmap

Your client has asked that you help identify any vulnerabilities with their file-sharing server. Using the Metasploitable machine to act as your client's server, complete the following:

- Command for Zenmap to run a service scan against the Metasploitable machine: 
<br>

      -A = Aggressive
      -O = Operating System detection
      -sV = enables services and version detection
      -v = Verbose
      -192.168.0.10 = metasploitable IP

 
- Bonus command to output results into a new text file named `zenmapscan.txt`:


      -nmap -sV -O -T3 -A -v -oN zenmapscan.txt 192.168.0.10 


- Zenmap vulnerability script command:

- Once you have identified this vulnerability, answer the following questions for your client:
  1. What is the vulnerability:

        - 192.168.0.10 is vulnerable to FTP attacks
        - this server is vulnerable to ftp-vsftpd-backdoor 
        - tmp fileshare allows anyone to read and write access


  2. Why is it dangerous: <br>


            This is dangerous because the hacker can gain access to the server and install malicious codes. 

  3. What mitigation strategies can you recommendations for the client to protect their server: <br>
